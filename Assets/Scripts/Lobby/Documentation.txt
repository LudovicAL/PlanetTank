This file explains a bit how the lobby is created & setup so you can personalize it.


The main prefab is in "Prefabs/LobbyManager". This is a canvas with the LobbyManager script on it.
It have multiple child that setup the UI & different "screens" of the lobby (i.e. Server List, Player Lsit etc...)

Everything above the "Unity UI Lobby" section in the Manager Inspector is from UnityEngine.Networking.NetworkLobbyManager, so see the doc
for it to see an explaination for all of them.

Prematch countdown is the time between all players being ready & the game starting.

The Lobbymanager script have reference to all the different screens for easy access.
*if you totally replace one of those screens, set its reference there*

Screens : 
=========

TopPanel
--------

As the name imply, this the top panel of the Lobby. It handle showing/hiding (esp when in game as esc. can show it back to "exit" the server)


MainPanel
---------
This is the panel that the player see first, on which they decide either to create a game throught matchmaker or directly.
It just take diverse references :
 - the lobby amnager
 - the Server List (i.e. the matchmaker panel)
 - the Lobby Panel (i.e. the actual lobby were player are listed)
 - &nboth input field (for match name & ip to join) to be able to watch for their modification

Server List
------------

 The server list panel will display all the match created throught the matchmaker.
 It just take reference to 
	- the UI rect where to add the server entry
	- the prefab for those server entry (see Prefabs/ServerInfoEntry)
	- The prefab to display when no server are found (see Prefabs/NoServerFound)

Lobby panel
-----------

The Lobby Panel is what is actually called the "lobby" : a list of player currently connected to the servers.

For that the scropt LobbyPlayerList need UI rect where to place those players
_Direct Play warning is only here as the prefab to display when you are in the lobby using directly IP (& not the matchmaker)_

InfoPanel
---------

It's simply a popup used to display thing.

Countdown Panel
---------------

Same but for the pre match countdown.


Prefabs
=======

The two prefabs that are important to look at for personalisation are PlayerInfo and ServerInfo. They are use to display
the entry in the list (repsectivly of player in the lobby & of servers) & have a script atatched to them to handle that.







This is a drag'n drop lobby solution for your game! It allow to quickly add the
capability to create game, either directly or through matchmaker, & join them.

Requirement
===========

You will need a prefab of your player, using a NetworkBehaviour instead of a monobehaviour


How to Use It
=============

- You will need 2 scenes : one for your lobby, one for your game.
- Just drag'n drop "Prefabs/LobbyUiCanvas" prefab in your lobby scene
- Setup the Lobby Scene & Play Scene of the lobby inspector
/!\ NOTE /!\ : Those scenes need to be in the build windows!

- Setup the Game Player Prefab in the same inspector. This prefab is the one that will be instanciated
when you go from the lobby to the game.


Passing info from lobby to play
===============================

You can pass info from the LobbyPlayer (by default name & color) to your game prefab using a script subclassing LobbyHook
and attaching that script to the same object as the lobby.

The function OnLobbyServerSceneLoadedForPlayer will be called ONLY ON THE SERVER with the lobbyPlayer and the gamePLayer, just copy anything you
need from one to the other. As this function is called only on the server, store them in SyncVar in your gameplayer and setup color and name from that script (in the star function for exemple, 
or using SyncVar hook)

(In the Meteroids Network Example, check NetworkLobbyHook for an example of how use it)

Known issues
============

There is a warning about "DontDestroyOnLoad only work for root GameObjects or components on root GameObjects.". You can ignore it.
It's harmless and normal : we put the LobbyPlayer in the hierarchy of the lobby to display them, and the manager set them internally as don't destroy on load.
As they are child of the lobby (which is don't destroy on load) they won't be destroy on load anyway.
